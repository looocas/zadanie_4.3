    <h1>I Still Have Faith in You</h1>
    <h3>Song by Abba</h3>
    <p>I still have faith in you<br>
    I see it now<br>
    Through all these years that faith lives on<br>
    Somehow</p>
    <p>There was a union<br>
    Of heart and mind<br>
    The likes of which are rare<br>
    And, oh, so hard to find<br></p>
    <p>Do I have it in me?<br>
    I believe it is in there<br>
    For I know I hear a bittersweet song<br>
    In the memories we share<br></p>
    <p>I still have faith in you<br>
    I see it now<br>
    Through all these years that faith lives on<br>
    Somehow</p>
    <p>Do I have it in me?<br>
    I believе it is in there<br>
    For I know I hear a bittеrsweet song<br>
    In the memories we share<br></p>
